# Handwriting Recognition App

This app uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the EMNIST ByClass dataset, which contains pictures of letters and digits, to predict a letter or digit handwritten by the user on a canvas.

The CNN was created using Python and TensorFlow/Keras and was trained on Google Colab. The model has a test accuracy of ~87%.
